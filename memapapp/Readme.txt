This is a college blog, you can add post for some particular places of BJUT.

I have made an example of the whole in terms of the current database. With it,
open the website, you could, for example, view previous all posts with pictures,
and make comments(posts are divided into different pages), follow other users
 and view them recent posts. 
In this case, it mainly shows how users could interact with each other.
Hilbert, Judeey and Jackson 's password are all 123456, you could use these accounts.

Without the current database, you could also initialize a new database, and begin 
with adding a profile or avatar and making posts.
